This is a Take Home Assesment given by American Express.

Promt:

My Aproch was to create a simple React App that would query the API and return data in an aproachable way.
I focused on the information that I would value as a reader which were, TITLE , AUTHOR NAME, PURCHASABLE ON AMAZON and GENRE.

My sort and filter parameters are focused on those 4 topics. Unfortunatly I was unable to Link genre with the Query API.

I had a fun time Exploring this API.

Any Questions and Notes are welcomed!
