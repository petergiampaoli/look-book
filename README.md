# Look Book

This is a Take Home Assesment given by American Express.

Promt:
"For this exercise you will create a simple web application that does the following:

Allow the user to search for a book.
Fetch and display a list of results from the Open Library API (https://openlibrary.org/developers/api).
Allow the user to sort and filter results.
Allow the user to click on a result and view additional details, including at least cover art and description.
If you don't finish within the time allotted, that's okay; submit what you've got anyway.

For the front end, please use HTML, CSS, React, and Redux. You can use whatever back end technology you want as long as it can be executed in a Unix environment."

My Aproch was to create a simple React App that would query the API and return data in an aproachable way.
I focused on the information that I would value as a reader which were, TITLE , AUTHOR NAME, PURCHASABLE ON AMAZON and GENRE.

My sort and filter parameters are focused on those 4 topics. Unfortunatly I was unable to Link genre with the Query API.

I had a fun time Exploring this API.

Any Questions and Notes are welcomed!
